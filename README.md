RAG Chatbot with LangChain - README
Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain and OpenAI's language models. The chatbot can answer questions based on a custom knowledge base, providing accurate and contextual responses grounded in external data.
Features

Load and process data from various formats (CSV, TXT)
Split documents into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval
Create vector embeddings for semantic search using OpenAI embeddings
Implement RAG pipeline using LangChain components
Interactive chat interface with Streamlit
Save conversation history for analysis

Files in this Repository

rag_chatbot.py: Core implementation of the RAG chatbot class
streamlit_app.py: Streamlit web application for interactive chatting
sample_data.csv: Example dataset containing ML concepts
sample_conversations.csv: Example Q&A pairs from the chatbot
requirements.txt: Required Python packages

How the RAG Chatbot Works
1. Data Loading and Processing
The chatbot loads data from a file (CSV or TXT) and processes it into document chunks suitable for retrieval:

For CSV files, each row becomes a document
Documents are split into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
This ensures manageable chunks that preserve context

2. Vector Store Creation
The processed documents are converted into vector embeddings and stored in a vector database:

OpenAI embeddings convert text to vector representations
FAISS is used as an efficient vector store
The vector store enables semantic similarity search

3. RAG Pipeline Setup
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline is created using LangChain components:

The retriever fetches relevant documents based on query similarity
A prompt template incorporates retrieved context with the user's question
The language model generates a response based on this enriched context

4. Response Generation
When a user asks a question:

The question is converted to a vector embedding
Similar documents are retrieved from the vector store
Retrieved documents and the question are combined in a prompt
The language model generates a contextually informed response

Installation Instructions

Clone this repository:

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-chatbot.git
cd rag-chatbot

Install required packages:

bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your OpenAI API key:

bashexport OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
Usage Guide
Basic Usage
pythonfrom rag_chatbot import RAGChatbot

# Initialize chatbot
api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
chatbot = RAGChatbot(api_key=api_key)

# Load and process data
documents = chatbot.load_and_process_data("your_data.csv", "csv")

# Build vector store
chatbot.build_vectorstore(documents)

# Set up RAG pipeline
chatbot.setup_rag_pipeline()

# Ask questions
response = chatbot.ask("What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?")
print(response)
Running the Streamlit App
bashstreamlit run streamlit_app.py
This will launch a web interface where you can:

Enter your OpenAI API key
Upload a knowledge base file
Initialize the chatbot
Chat with the RAG-enhanced assistant
Save your conversation history

Advantages of RAG Chatbots

Reduced hallucinations by grounding responses in factual data
Access to domain-specific knowledge not in the LLM's training
More up-to-date information than what the LLM was trained on
Transparency through attributable sources of information
Customizable knowledge base for specific use cases

Future Improvements

Add support for more document types (PDF, HTML, etc.)
Implement hybrid search for better retrieval
Add source attribution in responses
Support for multi-modal RAG (images, audio)
Fine-tuning capabilities for domain adaptation
